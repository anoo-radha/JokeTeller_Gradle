# Gradle for Android and Java Final Project

In this project, you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses
multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist
of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints
(GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an
activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the
GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

# How to Use the Project
Download the project or clone the project. Open it in android studio and build using freedebug or paiddebug build variant and run the app.

Jokes can be added/modified in the JokeFactory Java library.
To add them to the local backend, choose backend as run configuration and Rebuild your project (via "Build â†’ Rebuild Project") and launch this run configuration. It will invoke appengineRun task in Gradle plug-in for App Engine, which in turn will start the local App Engine Java development server.

But to add them to GCE app engine, Run Build > Deploy Module to App Engine.

##How Do I Complete this Project?

### Step 0: Starting Point

This is the starting point for the final project, which is provided to you in
the [course repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud867/tree/master/FinalProject). It
contains an activity with a banner ad and a button that purports to tell a
joke, but actually just complains. The banner ad was set up following the
instructions here:

https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/admob/android/quick-start

You may need to download the Google Repository from the Extras section of the
Android SDK Manager.

When you can build an deploy this starter code to an emulator, you're ready to
move on.

### Step 1: Create a Java library

Your first task is to create a Java library that provides jokes. Create a new
Gradle Java project either using the Android Studio wizard, or by hand. Then
introduce a project dependency between your app and the new Java Library. If
you need review, check out demo 4.01 from the course code.

Make the button display a toast showing a joke retrieved from your Java joke
telling library.

### Step 2: Create an Android Library

Create an Android Library containing an Activity that will display a joke
passed to it as an intent extra. Wire up project dependencies so that the
button can now pass the joke from the Java Library to the Android Library.

For review on how to create an Android library, check out demo 4.03. For a
refresher on intent extras, check out;

### Step 3: Create GCE Module

This next task will be pretty tricky. Instead of pulling jokes directly from
our Java library, we'll set up a Google Cloud Endpoints development server,
and pull our jokes from there. Follow the instructions in the following
tutorial to add a Google Could Endpoints module to your project:

https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gradle-appengine-templates/tree/master/HelloEndpoints

Introduce a project dependency between your Java library and your GCE module,
and modify the GCE starter code to pull jokes from your Java library. Create
an Async task to retrieve jokes. Make the button kick off a task to retrieve a
joke, then launch the activity from your Android Library to display it.

### Step 4: Add Functional Tests

Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server.
Add code to test that your Async task successfully retrieves a non-empty
string. For a refresher on setting up Android tests, check out demo 4.09.

### Step 5: Add a Paid Flavor

Add free and paid product flavors to your app. Remove the ad (and any
dependencies you can) from the paid flavor.

## Optional Tasks

For extra practice to make your project stand out, complete the following tasks.

### Add Interstitial Ad

Follow these instructions to add an interstitial ad to the free version.
Display the ad after the user hits the button, but before the joke is shown.

https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/admob/android/interstitial

### Add Loading Indicator

Add a loading indicator that is shown while the joke is being retrieved and
disappears when the joke is ready. The following tutorial is a good place to
start:

http://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/android_loading_spinner.htm

### Configure Test Task

To tie it all together, create a Gradle task that:

1. Launches the GCE local development server
2. Runs all tests
3. Shuts the server down again

# Things learnt from the project
Had some issues with deploying the GCE app engine.
Used these command line instructions
>gcloud beta app create

and 

>gcloud app deploy

then the gce app engine was deployed.
